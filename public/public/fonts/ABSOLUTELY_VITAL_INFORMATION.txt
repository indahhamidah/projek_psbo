Barley is a round and flowing script typeface.
It is handmade by Måns Grebäck and works perfectly for logotypes and slogans. 
The font contains a lot of alternate characters and ligatures to make the script simulate a handpainted logo. 
With its hundreds of glyphs it also has support for a wide range of languages. 

Write underscores before any word to make an underline. 
Example: _Barley

If your software supports ligatures, you can write multiple underscores for a longer line. 
Example: __Bakeries
